# üéØ Untether: Revolutionary Financial Wellness Platform

## Vision Statement
Untether is transforming personal finance by making every bill payment an opportunity to earn rewards, every financial decision an educational moment, and every user part of a supportive community working toward financial freedom.

## üöÄ Core Innovation: Untether Credit Card Rewards System

### The Game-Changing Feature
**Untether Credit Card Rewards** revolutionizes how people pay bills by:
- **Automatically paying bills** using your saved credit card
- **Crediting your checking account** for the same amount
- **Earning credit card rewards** on ALL bill payments (rent, utilities, insurance, etc.)
- **Fully automated** - no manual work required

### Why This Matters
Traditional credit card rewards exclude the biggest expenses (rent, utilities, insurance) because they're typically paid via bank transfer. Untether bridges this gap, allowing users to earn 2-3% cashback on ALL their bills, potentially saving hundreds or thousands annually.
